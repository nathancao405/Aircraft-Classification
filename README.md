# ✈️ Aircraft Classification using TensorFlow

An end-to-end deep learning project that classifies **100 aircraft variants** using the **FGVC Aircraft Dataset**. The project leverages **transfer learning with MobileNetV2**, TensorFlow data pipelines, and fine-tuning to build an image classification model capable of distinguishing visually similar aircraft.

## Model Architecture

The model uses **MobileNetV2** pretrained on **ImageNet** as the feature extractor.

### Pipeline

```
Input Image
      │
Data Augmentation
      │
MobileNetV2 (Pretrained)
      │
Global Average Pooling
      │
Dropout
      │
Dense Softmax Layer
      │
100 Aircraft Classes
```

Transfer learning was first performed with the pretrained backbone frozen. The final 30 layers were then unfrozen and fine-tuned using a smaller learning rate to improve aircraft-specific feature learning.

## Results

| Metric | Value |
|---------|-------:|
| Number of Classes | 100 |
| Training Images | 3,334 |
| Validation Images | 3,333 |
| Testing Images | 3,333 |
| Final Test Accuracy | **29.7%** |

### Training Loss

Although the overall accuracy appears modest, this dataset represents a **fine-grained classification problem**, where many aircraft variants have extremely similar visual characteristics. Distinguishing between these aircraft is significantly more challenging than standard image classification datasets.
